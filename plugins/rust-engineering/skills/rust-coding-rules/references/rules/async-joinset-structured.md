> Use `JoinSet` for managing dynamic collections of spawned tasks

<!-- rulebook-meta: source=leonardomso/rust-skills@1.5.1; owner=rust-concurrency; supporters=`rust-ownership`; status=conditional -->

## Decision

Consider this rule only after its prerequisites are satisfied: Use `JoinSet` for managing dynamic collections of spawned tasks.

## Apply When

Apply when suspension, task ownership, cancellation, backpressure, blocking work, or async runtime behavior controls correctness or liveness, and current code establishes the premise described below.

## Avoid When

Do not apply mechanically when a synchronous call path is sufficient, or adopting a runtime or channel would add an unapproved dependency or protocol. A conflicting project contract or owner-profile decision wins.

## Algorithm

1. Inspect the actual callers, invariants, repository instructions, toolchain, target, features, and accepted dependencies.
2. Confirm the concrete trigger for this rule; a keyword or hypothetical future need is insufficient.
3. Define task ownership, suspension and cancellation points, bounds, shutdown, and observation before choosing the async primitive.
4. Implement the smallest coherent option, compare material alternatives, and run evidence that can falsify the decision.

## Trade-offs

Async scales suspended I/O but introduces executor, cancellation, Send, lifetime, and observability constraints.

## Prerequisites

- The user and project contract, actual callers, edition, MSRV, toolchain, target, and feature matrix take precedence over this rule.
- External crates referenced by the source (`tokio-util`, `tokio`, `futures`, `log`) must already be accepted by the project or be approved before addition.
- Runtime, task ownership, cancellation, capacity, blocking, and shutdown behavior must be known.

## Verification

Test success, cancellation, close, timeout, overload, and clean shutdown with bounded deterministic waits.

## Why It Matters

When spawning a variable number of tasks, collecting `JoinHandle`s in a `Vec` and using `join_all` works but lacks flexibility. `JoinSet` provides a better abstraction: add/remove tasks dynamically, get results as they complete, and abort all on drop. It's the idiomatic way to manage task collections.

## Bad

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Bad illustration -->
```rust
// Manual handle management
let mut handles: Vec<JoinHandle<Result<Data>>> = Vec::new();

for url in urls {
    handles.push(tokio::spawn(fetch(url)));
}

// Wait for all, in order (not as they complete)
let results = futures::future::join_all(handles).await;

// No easy way to cancel all, handle errors progressively, or add more tasks
```

## Good

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Good illustration -->
```rust
use tokio::task::JoinSet;

let mut set = JoinSet::new();

for url in urls {
    set.spawn(fetch(url.clone()));
}

// Process results as they complete
while let Some(result) = set.join_next().await {
    match result {
        Ok(Ok(data)) => process(data),
        Ok(Err(e)) => log::error!("Task failed: {}", e),
        Err(e) => log::error!("Task panicked: {}", e),
    }
}

// All tasks done, set is empty
```

## Dynamic Task Addition

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Dynamic Task Addition illustration -->
```rust
use tokio::task::JoinSet;

async fn worker_pool(mut rx: mpsc::Receiver<Task>) {
    let mut set = JoinSet::new();
    let max_concurrent = 10;
    
    loop {
        tokio::select! {
            // Accept new tasks if under limit
            Some(task) = rx.recv(), if set.len() < max_concurrent => {
                set.spawn(process_task(task));
            }
            
            // Process completed tasks
            Some(result) = set.join_next() => {
                handle_result(result);
            }
            
            // Exit when no tasks and channel closed
            else => break,
        }
    }
}
```

## Abort on Drop

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Abort on Drop illustration -->
```rust
use tokio::task::JoinSet;

{
    let mut set = JoinSet::new();
    set.spawn(long_running_task());
    set.spawn(another_task());
    
    // Early exit
    return;
}  // JoinSet dropped here - all tasks are aborted!

// Explicit abort
let mut set = JoinSet::new();
set.spawn(task());
set.abort_all();  // Cancel all tasks
```

## Error Handling Pattern

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Error Handling Pattern illustration -->
```rust
use tokio::task::JoinSet;

async fn fetch_all(urls: &[String]) -> Vec<Result<Data, Error>> {
    let mut set = JoinSet::new();
    let mut results = Vec::new();
    
    for url in urls {
        set.spawn(fetch(url.clone()));
    }
    
    while let Some(join_result) = set.join_next().await {
        let result = match join_result {
            Ok(task_result) => task_result,
            Err(join_error) => {
                if join_error.is_panic() {
                    Err(Error::TaskPanicked)
                } else {
                    Err(Error::TaskCancelled)
                }
            }
        };
        results.push(result);
    }
    
    results
}
```

## With Cancellation

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the With Cancellation illustration -->
```rust
use tokio::task::JoinSet;
use tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken;

async fn run_workers(shutdown: CancellationToken) {
    let mut set = JoinSet::new();
    
    for i in 0..4 {
        let token = shutdown.child_token();
        set.spawn(async move {
            loop {
                tokio::select! {
                    _ = token.cancelled() => break,
                    _ = do_work(i) => {}
                }
            }
        });
    }
    
    // Wait for shutdown
    shutdown.cancelled().await;
    
    // Abort remaining tasks
    set.abort_all();
    
    // Wait for all to finish (drain aborted tasks)
    while set.join_next().await.is_some() {}
}
```

## Spawning with Context

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Spawning with Context illustration -->
```rust
use tokio::task::JoinSet;

let mut set: JoinSet<(usize, Result<Data, Error>)> = JoinSet::new();

for (index, url) in urls.iter().enumerate() {
    let url = url.clone();
    set.spawn(async move {
        (index, fetch(&url).await)
    });
}

// Results include their index
while let Some(result) = set.join_next().await {
    if let Ok((index, data)) = result {
        results[index] = Some(data);
    }
}
```
