> Include `# Examples` with runnable code

<!-- rulebook-meta: source=leonardomso/rust-skills@1.5.1; owner=rust-documentation; supporters=`rust-api-design`; status=adapted -->

## Decision

Use this context-sensitive Rust decision when its premise is established: Include `# Examples` with runnable code.

## Apply When

Apply when a user-facing or safety-relevant Rust contract needs discoverable guarantees, examples, errors, panics, features, or migration guidance, and current code establishes the premise described below.

## Avoid When

Do not apply mechanically when the prose would duplicate volatile implementation detail or claim behavior not established by current code and tests. A conflicting project contract or owner-profile decision wins.

## Algorithm

1. Inspect the actual callers, invariants, repository instructions, toolchain, target, features, and accepted dependencies.
2. Confirm the concrete trigger for this rule; a keyword or hypothetical future need is insufficient.
3. Identify the reader path and contract, write the smallest complete example, and link to one authoritative detailed explanation.
4. Implement the smallest coherent option, compare material alternatives, and run evidence that can falsify the decision.

## Trade-offs

More documentation improves discoverability but duplicated volatile detail drifts; executable examples cost maintenance but catch contract regressions.

## Prerequisites

- The user and project contract, actual callers, edition, MSRV, toolchain, target, and feature matrix take precedence over this rule.
- Public compatibility and downstream caller impact must be known before changing an exported contract.

## Verification

Run rustdoc links and doctests under intended features and inspect that examples include their actual prerequisites.

## Why It Matters

Examples are the most valuable part of documentation. They show users exactly how to use your API. Rust's doc tests ensure examples stay correct as code evolves.

## Bad

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Bad illustration -->
```rust
/// Parses a string into a Foo.
pub fn parse(s: &str) -> Result<Foo, Error> {
    // No examples - users have to guess usage
}

/// A widget for doing things.
/// 
/// This widget is very useful.
pub struct Widget {
    // Still no examples
}
```

## Good

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Good illustration -->
```rust
/// Parses a string into a Foo.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use my_crate::parse;
///
/// let foo = parse("hello").unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(foo.name(), "hello");
/// ```
///
/// Handles empty strings:
///
/// ```
/// use my_crate::parse;
///
/// let foo = parse("").unwrap();
/// assert!(foo.is_empty());
/// ```
pub fn parse(s: &str) -> Result<Foo, Error> {
    // ...
}
```

## Use ? Not unwrap()

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Use ? Not unwrap() illustration -->
```rust
/// Loads configuration from a file.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// use my_crate::Config;
///
/// let config = Config::load("config.toml")?;
/// println!("Port: {}", config.port);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
pub fn load(path: &str) -> Result<Config, Error> {
    // ...
}
```

## Hide Setup Code

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Hide Setup Code illustration -->
```rust
/// Processes items from a database.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use my_crate::{Database, Item};
/// # fn get_db() -> Database { Database::mock() }
/// let db = get_db();
/// let items = db.process_items()?;
/// assert!(!items.is_empty());
/// # Ok::<(), my_crate::Error>(())
/// ```
pub fn process_items(&self) -> Result<Vec<Item>, Error> {
    // ...
}
```

## Multiple Examples

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Multiple Examples illustration -->
```rust
/// Creates a new buffer with the specified capacity.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
///
/// ```
/// use my_crate::Buffer;
///
/// let buf = Buffer::with_capacity(1024);
/// assert_eq!(buf.capacity(), 1024);
/// ```
///
/// Zero capacity creates an empty buffer:
///
/// ```
/// use my_crate::Buffer;
///
/// let buf = Buffer::with_capacity(0);
/// assert!(buf.is_empty());
/// ```
pub fn with_capacity(cap: usize) -> Self {
    // ...
}
```

## Show Error Cases

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Show Error Cases illustration -->
```rust
/// Divides two numbers.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use my_crate::divide;
///
/// assert_eq!(divide(10, 2), Ok(5));
/// ```
///
/// Division by zero returns an error:
///
/// ```
/// use my_crate::{divide, MathError};
///
/// assert_eq!(divide(10, 0), Err(MathError::DivisionByZero));
/// ```
pub fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> Result<i32, MathError> {
    // ...
}
```

## Running Doc Tests

```bash
# Run all doc tests
cargo test --doc

# Run doc tests for specific item
cargo test --doc my_function
```
