> Use static assertions to guard against accidental type size growth

<!-- rulebook-meta: source=leonardomso/rust-skills@1.5.1; owner=rust-performance; supporters=`rust-ownership`, `rust-stdlib`; status=conditional -->

## Decision

Consider this rule only after its prerequisites are satisfied: Use static assertions to guard against accidental type size growth.

## Apply When

Apply when a measured allocation, footprint, locality, move, or layout cost is material on the representative workload, and current code establishes the premise described below.

## Avoid When

Do not apply mechanically when there is no profile or size evidence, or the change would complicate ownership, portability, or correctness for a noise-level gain. A conflicting project contract or owner-profile decision wins.

## Algorithm

1. Inspect the actual callers, invariants, repository instructions, toolchain, target, features, and accepted dependencies.
2. Confirm the concrete trigger for this rule; a keyword or hypothetical future need is insufficient.
3. Measure allocation or layout first, change one representation or reuse decision, and compare the same workload.
4. Implement the smallest coherent option, compare material alternatives, and run evidence that can falsify the decision.

## Trade-offs

Inline storage, boxing, arenas, compact types, and reuse exchange simplicity, code size, stack use, locality, or dependency cost.

## Prerequisites

- The user and project contract, actual callers, edition, MSRV, toolchain, target, and feature matrix take precedence over this rule.
- External crates referenced by the source (`bytes`, `static_assertions`) must already be accepted by the project or be approved before addition.
- A representative measurement must identify the relevant hot path, allocation, footprint, contention, or artifact constraint.

## Verification

Keep correctness tests green and record before/after allocations, type size, memory footprint, or representative benchmark evidence.

## Why It Matters

Adding a field to a frequently-instantiated struct can silently bloat memory usage. Static size assertions catch this at compile time, making size changes intentional rather than accidental. This is especially important for types stored in large collections or passed frequently by value.

## Bad

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Bad illustration -->
```rust
struct Event {
    timestamp: u64,
    kind: EventKind,
    payload: [u8; 32],
}

// Later, someone adds a field without realizing the impact
struct Event {
    timestamp: u64,
    kind: EventKind,
    payload: [u8; 32],
    metadata: String,  // Silently adds 24 bytes!
}

// 10 million events now use 240MB more memory
// No warning, no review trigger
```

## Good

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Good illustration -->
```rust
struct Event {
    timestamp: u64,
    kind: EventKind,
    payload: [u8; 32],
}

// Static assertion - breaks compile if size changes
const _: () = assert!(std::mem::size_of::<Event>() == 48);

// Or with static_assertions crate
use static_assertions::assert_eq_size;
assert_eq_size!(Event, [u8; 48]);

// Now adding metadata triggers compile error:
// error: assertion failed: std::mem::size_of::<Event>() == 48
```

## static_assertions Crate

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the staticassertions Crate illustration -->
```rust
use static_assertions::{assert_eq_size, const_assert};

struct Critical {
    id: u64,
    flags: u32,
    data: [u8; 16],
}

// Exact size assertion
assert_eq_size!(Critical, [u8; 32]);

// Maximum size assertion
const_assert!(std::mem::size_of::<Critical>() <= 64);

// Alignment assertion
const_assert!(std::mem::align_of::<Critical>() == 8);

// Compare sizes
assert_eq_size!(Critical, [u64; 4]);
```

## Built-in Const Assertions

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Built-in Const Assertions illustration -->
```rust
// No external crate needed (Rust 1.57+)
struct Packet {
    header: u32,
    payload: [u8; 60],
}

const _: () = assert!(
    std::mem::size_of::<Packet>() == 64,
    "Packet must be exactly 64 bytes for protocol compliance"
);

// Compile error shows custom message if assertion fails
```

## Documenting Size Constraints

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Documenting Size Constraints illustration -->
```rust
/// Network protocol packet header.
/// 
/// # Size
/// 
/// This struct is guaranteed to be exactly 32 bytes to match
/// the network protocol specification. Any changes to fields
/// must maintain this size constraint.
#[repr(C)]  // Predictable layout for FFI
struct Header {
    version: u16,
    flags: u16,
    length: u32,
    checksum: u64,
    reserved: [u8; 16],
}

const _: () = assert!(std::mem::size_of::<Header>() == 32);
```

## Testing Size Stability

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Testing Size Stability illustration -->
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn critical_types_have_expected_sizes() {
        // Document expected sizes in tests too
        assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Event>(), 48);
        assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Message>(), 64);
        assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Header>(), 32);
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn cache_line_aligned() {
        // Verify cache-friendly sizing
        assert!(std::mem::size_of::<HotData>() <= 64);
    }
}
```

## When to Assert

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the When to Assert illustration -->
```rust
// ✅ Types stored in large collections
struct Node { /* ... */ }
const _: () = assert!(std::mem::size_of::<Node>() <= 64);

// ✅ Types used in FFI / binary protocols
#[repr(C)]
struct WireFormat { /* ... */ }
const _: () = assert!(std::mem::size_of::<WireFormat>() == 256);

// ✅ Performance-critical types
struct HotPath { /* ... */ }
const _: () = assert!(std::mem::size_of::<HotPath>() <= 128);

// ❌ Skip for rarely-instantiated types
struct AppConfig { /* many fields */ }
// Size doesn't matter, only one instance
```
