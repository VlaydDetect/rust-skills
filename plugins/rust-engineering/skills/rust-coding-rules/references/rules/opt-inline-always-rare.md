> Use `#[inline(always)]` sparingly—only for critical hot paths proven by profiling## Decision

Consider this rule only after its prerequisites are satisfied: Use `#[inline(always)]` sparingly—only for critical hot paths proven by profiling.

## Apply When

Apply when a reproducible profile or benchmark identifies a compiler, codegen, branch, cache, or target-specific bottleneck, and current code establishes the premise described below.

## Avoid When

Do not apply mechanically when the workload, deployment target, or portability contract is unknown, or the expected benefit is speculative. A conflicting project contract or owner-profile decision wins.

## Algorithm

1. Inspect the actual callers, invariants, repository instructions, toolchain, target, features, and accepted dependencies.
2. Confirm the concrete trigger for this rule; a keyword or hypothetical future need is insufficient.
3. Hold toolchain, target, profile, features, inputs, and hardware constant; test one optimization hypothesis at a time.
4. Implement the smallest coherent option, compare material alternatives, and run evidence that can falsify the decision.

## Trade-offs

LTO, codegen, inlining, PGO, SIMD, and target tuning can trade build time, size, portability, debuggability, and determinism.

## Prerequisites

- The user and project contract, actual callers, edition, MSRV, toolchain, target, and feature matrix take precedence over this rule.
- External crates referenced by the source (`bytes`, `criterion`) must already be accepted by the project or be approved before addition.
- A representative measurement must identify the relevant hot path, allocation, footprint, contention, or artifact constraint.

## Verification

Compare repeated release-like measurements and artifact or codegen evidence while preserving functional behavior and fallback targets.

## Why It Matters

`#[inline(always)]` forces the compiler to inline a function regardless of heuristics. Overuse increases binary size, hurts instruction cache, and can slow down code. The compiler is usually smarter about inlining than humans. Reserve this for measured hot paths where benchmarks prove a benefit.

## Bad

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Bad illustration -->
```rust
// Annotating everything - trusting intuition over data
#[inline(always)]
pub fn get_name(&self) -> &str {
    &self.name
}

#[inline(always)]
pub fn calculate_tax(amount: f64) -> f64 {
    amount * 0.1
}

#[inline(always)]
fn helper(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

// Result: bloated binary, poor cache utilization
```

## Good

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Good illustration -->
```rust
// Let compiler decide for most functions
pub fn get_name(&self) -> &str {
    &self.name
}

pub fn calculate_tax(amount: f64) -> f64 {
    amount * 0.1
}

// Only force inline for proven hot paths
impl Hasher for MyHasher {
    // Hasher::write is called millions of times in tight loops
    // Profiling showed 15% improvement from forced inlining
    #[inline(always)]
    fn write(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) {
        // Very small, very hot
        self.state = self.state.wrapping_add(bytes.len() as u64);
    }
}
```

## When #[inline(always)] Helps

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the When #[inline(always)] Helps illustration -->
```rust
// ✅ Tiny functions in hot inner loops
#[inline(always)]
fn fast_hash(a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 {
    a.wrapping_mul(b).wrapping_add(a)
}

// ✅ Generic functions that benefit from monomorphization
#[inline(always)]
fn swap<T>(a: &mut T, b: &mut T) {
    std::mem::swap(a, b);
}

// ✅ Iterator adapters and closures
#[inline(always)]
fn apply<T, F: Fn(T) -> T>(f: F, x: T) -> T {
    f(x)
}

// ✅ SIMD/vectorization helpers
#[inline(always)]
fn add_simd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], out: &mut [f32]) {
    // ...
}
```

## Inline Variants

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Inline Variants illustration -->
```rust
// #[inline] - hint to inline, compiler may ignore
#[inline]
fn suggested_inline(x: i32) -> i32 { x + 1 }

// #[inline(always)] - force inline (almost always)
#[inline(always)]
fn force_inline(x: i32) -> i32 { x + 1 }

// #[inline(never)] - prevent inlining (for profiling, code size)
#[inline(never)]
fn no_inline(x: i32) -> i32 { x + 1 }

// No annotation - compiler decides based on heuristics
fn compiler_decides(x: i32) -> i32 { x + 1 }
```

## Measuring Inline Impact

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Measuring Inline Impact illustration -->
```rust
// Use criterion to benchmark
use criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};

fn bench_with_inline(c: &mut Criterion) {
    c.bench_function("hot_path_inline", |b| {
        b.iter(|| hot_loop())
    });
}

// Compare binary sizes
// cargo bloat --release --crates

// Check if function was inlined
// cargo asm --rust my_crate::hot_function
```

## Generic Functions

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Generic Functions illustration -->
```rust
// Generic functions across crate boundaries often need #[inline]
// Because the generic code is compiled in the calling crate

// In library crate:
#[inline]  // Allow inlining in downstream crates
pub fn generic_function<T: Display>(x: T) {
    println!("{}", x);
}

// Without #[inline], the generic function can't be inlined
// across crate boundaries even if beneficial
```
