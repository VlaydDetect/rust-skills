# proj-prelude-module

> Create prelude module for common imports## Decision

Consider this rule only after its prerequisites are satisfied: Create prelude module for common imports.

## Apply When

Apply when a demonstrated module, crate, visibility, target, feature, MSRV, or build-script boundary needs clearer ownership, and current code establishes the premise described below.

## Avoid When

Do not apply mechanically when the change is driven only by file size or speculative reuse and would add package, public API, build, or migration cost. A conflicting project contract or owner-profile decision wins.

## Algorithm

1. Inspect the actual callers, invariants, repository instructions, toolchain, target, features, and accepted dependencies.
2. Confirm the concrete trigger for this rule; a keyword or hypothetical future need is insufficient.
3. Map current owners and public paths, choose the cheapest boundary that enforces responsibility, and plan all callers and configurations.
4. Implement the smallest coherent option, compare material alternatives, and run evidence that can falsify the decision.

## Trade-offs

Stronger boundaries improve ownership and isolation while adding navigation, build graph, feature, release, and migration overhead.

## Prerequisites

- The user and project contract, actual callers, edition, MSRV, toolchain, target, and feature matrix take precedence over this rule.
- External crates referenced by the source (`serde`) must already be accepted by the project or be approved before addition.

## Verification

Inspect cargo metadata and public paths, then compile affected packages, features, targets, docs, tests, and generated boundaries.

## Why It Matters

A `prelude` module collects the most commonly used types and traits for glob import. Users write `use my_crate::prelude::*` instead of many individual imports. This follows the pattern established by `std::prelude`.

## Bad

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Bad illustration -->
```rust
// Users must import everything individually
use my_crate::Client;
use my_crate::Config;
use my_crate::Error;
use my_crate::Request;
use my_crate::Response;
use my_crate::traits::Handler;
use my_crate::traits::Middleware;
use my_crate::types::Method;
```

## Good

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Good illustration -->
```rust
// src/lib.rs
pub mod prelude {
    pub use crate::{
        Client,
        Config,
        Error,
        Request,
        Response,
    };
    pub use crate::traits::{Handler, Middleware};
    pub use crate::types::Method;
}

// Users write:
use my_crate::prelude::*;
```

## What to Include

| Include | Don't Include |
|---------|---------------|
| Core types users always need | Rarely-used types |
| Common traits | Implementation details |
| Error types | Internal helpers |
| Extension traits | Feature-gated items (usually) |
| Type aliases | Everything |

## Example: Web Framework Prelude

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Example: Web Framework Prelude illustration -->
```rust
pub mod prelude {
    // Core request/response
    pub use crate::{Request, Response, Body};
    
    // Error handling
    pub use crate::Error;
    
    // Common traits
    pub use crate::traits::{FromRequest, IntoResponse};
    
    // Routing
    pub use crate::Router;
    
    // HTTP types
    pub use crate::http::{Method, StatusCode};
}
```

## Example: Database Library Prelude

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Example: Database Library Prelude illustration -->
```rust
pub mod prelude {
    // Connection and pool
    pub use crate::{Connection, Pool};
    
    // Query building
    pub use crate::query::{Query, Select, Insert, Update, Delete};
    
    // Traits for custom types
    pub use crate::traits::{FromRow, ToSql};
    
    // Error type
    pub use crate::Error;
}
```

## Pattern: Tiered Preludes

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Pattern: Tiered Preludes illustration -->
```rust
// Minimal prelude
pub mod prelude {
    pub use crate::{Client, Config, Error};
}

// Full prelude for power users
pub mod full_prelude {
    pub use crate::prelude::*;
    pub use crate::advanced::*;
    pub use crate::extensions::*;
}
```

## Pattern: Feature-Gated Prelude Items

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Pattern: Feature-Gated Prelude Items illustration -->
```rust
pub mod prelude {
    pub use crate::{Client, Error};
    
    #[cfg(feature = "async")]
    pub use crate::async_client::AsyncClient;
    
    #[cfg(feature = "serde")]
    pub use crate::serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
}
```

## Guidelines

1. **Be conservative** - Only include truly common items
2. **Avoid conflicts** - Don't include names that might clash (e.g., `Error`)
3. **Document it** - List what's included in module docs
4. **Stay stable** - Removing items is breaking change

## Documenting the Prelude

<!-- rust-example: fragment; missing: surrounding domain types, functions, imports, and crate context referenced by the Documenting the Prelude illustration -->
```rust
//! Common imports for convenient glob importing.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```
//! use my_crate::prelude::*;
//! ```
//!
//! # Contents
//!
//! This prelude re-exports:
//! - [`Client`] - The main API client
//! - [`Config`] - Client configuration
//! - [`Error`] - Error type
pub mod prelude {
    // ...
}
```
